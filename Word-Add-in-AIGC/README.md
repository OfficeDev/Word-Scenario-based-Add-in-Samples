## Summary

Learn how to build a practical Office Add-in with cool features for content generation, utilizing either AI or predefined content. This sample will help you understand how to manage content in an Office Add-in.

## Features
- Import the document template
- Incorporate content generated by the Azure OpenAI service or predefined titles, comments, and footnotes into the Word document
- Customize the document style
- Insert predefined image into the document

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft 365
- *Optional*: If you're interested in exploring AIGC, follow the procedure to request an Azure OpenAI service account. Find more details at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cpython&pivots=rest-api.

## Play with the sample add-in
The following links will take you to documentation for how to sideload on Windows and Mac. Be sure you have a local copy of the manifest.xml file for this sample. Then follow the sideloading instructions for your platform.
- [Sideload Office Add-ins for testing from a network share](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins)
- [Sideload Office Add-ins on Mac for testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-mac)


## Run the sample code and debug
### Manually run on your local machine
If you prefer to run the sample with clear and step-by-step instructions, follow the detailed steps provided below.
1. Install a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
4. *Optional*: If you're interested in exploring AIGC, with prerequisites all satisfied, you can fill in the parameters apiKey, endpoint and deployment in src/taskpane/components/utility/AIData.tsx to persist the Azure OpenAI account or you can skip this step to fill in the account when you operate the AI related UI.
5. If you cannot get an OpenAI account, just try the predefined functionality. Just go ahead.
6. cd src folder and execute following commands:
    ```console
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
7. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
