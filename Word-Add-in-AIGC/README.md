## Build, run and debug the sample code 
### Prerequisites
- You need to have a Microsoft 365 account to try the sample. You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.
- [Optional] If you're interested in exploring AIGC, follow the procedure to request an Azure OpenAI service account. Find more details at [Deploy a model and generate text using Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cpython&pivots=rest-api)
  
### Manually run on your local machine
To run the sample on desktop, please follow the detailed steps provided below.
1. Install a recent version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer. To verify if you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2. Clone the repo to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
4. [Optional] If you're interested in exploring AIGC, with prerequisites all satisfied, you can fill in the parameters apiKey, endpoint and deployment in `src/taskpane/components/utility/AIData.tsx` to persist the Azure OpenAI account. Or you can skip this step if you just want to try the predefined functionality.
6. cd src folder and execute following commands:
    ```console
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
7. Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
